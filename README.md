# heart_disease_ml
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on medical features using machine learning models. The dataset contains information such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more. The goal is to classify individuals as either healthy or having heart disease using various supervised learning algorithms.


*Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning*
Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning models based on a dataset of 303 patient records and 14 medical attributes, including age, cholesterol level, and exercise-induced angina. The goal is to classify individuals as either healthy or at risk of heart disease.

Dataset
The dataset used is the Heart Disease Dataset from the UCI repository, containing 303 instances and the following key attributes:

Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type, Cholesterol, Maximum Heart Rate, Exercise-Induced Angina, and more.
Target variable: 0 = No Heart Disease, 1 = Heart Disease.

Models Used
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Results
The models achieved an accuracy of approximately 85%, with Logistic Regression and SVM performing the best.
Key features influencing predictions included cholesterol levels, age, and exercise-induced angina.
